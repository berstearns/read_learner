# RL rat game 
-	 The rat game consists on the agent(rat) seeking the cheese
-	 In this sense the rat knows apriori his objective and it doesn't change over the iterations(time). So it has a fixed Q function
- The Fixed Q function is related to rat's distance in relation to the cheese, but them does rat knows a priori where the cheese is?
	1. If the rat did know where the cheese is , he would know apriori the best moves
-	 which enables him to evaluate the Q function for any state
